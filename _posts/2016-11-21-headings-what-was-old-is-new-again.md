    Seems the HTML WG has reversed course on
    how heading tags should be used.

Seems HTML WG has reversed course on a previous recommendation that allowed `sections` to have their own `H1` tag, now recommending the previous norm of cascading H tags.

<blockquote>
Given that this bug has been around, and not fixed in browsers, for many  
years, we are proposing to remove the suggestion, and return to the model  
where elements `h1..h6` have a defined level of their own.
