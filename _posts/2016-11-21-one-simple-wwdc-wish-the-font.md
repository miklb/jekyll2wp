    My one simple ask from Apple for WWDC
    next week. A font.
---
My feed reader and Twitter timeline are full of posts with wish lists for next week's Apple World Wide Developer conference. Siri this, iOS 10 that. And I'm sure some of the ideas are great and I'll be happy when they are at my disposal.

But all I want is for Apple to include the font from the [WWDC web site](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). When the site launched, it took me some time to realize the page is a giant image. A simple monospaced font on a background you'd find in a terminal or code editor app. It's beautiful and I want it for my own.
