    Couch-to-5k first week in the books.
    More progress, more lessons learned.
---
First week (well, 3 runs) in the book. Lesson learned today is take the little twinges of discomfort serious. I had minor discomfort in my right ankle but pushed through, and am now feeling that I was compensating for it. I may need to wait until Friday to start the next week, but that's to be determined. Consider me day-to-day on the injury report.

The other take away from today was, despite being a native Floridian, it's easy to forget the seriousness humidity contributes to the *feels like* temperature. I may want to start timing my runs for morning, or later in the evening (though the summer weather patterns might not play nice with evening runs in general.)

Stats:

* Distance: 1.75 mi
* Pace: 11:29 min/mi
