I spent last evening making the necessary tweaks to this site to get a perfect 100% score on Google's
[Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). I understand this is just a personal site, but at the root,understanding how to make this site fast will translate to helping bigger projects keep an eye out for potential bottle necks.

Which is why when Aaron Gustafson [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/724448660076027904) this posts headline, it caught my eye.

<blockquote>
Either way, you could do much worse than to make your bit of the web fast.

The context was more broad and I believe directed towards larger sites, but it has to start somewhere.

Also, I plan on sharing how I implemented the changes to get to 100%, specifically the critical CSS.
